== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How often should I run the server performance tests? =

We recommend running the tests once a week to track your server's performance over time. However, you can run them as often as you like, especially after making changes to your server configuration.

= Will running these tests affect my site's performance? =

The tests are designed to be non-intrusive, but they do use some server resources. We recommend running them during low-traffic periods to minimize any potential impact on your site's performance.
